<p>
We started with a simple ideaâ€”that everyone should be able to access critical information everywhere. For consumers, we are creating one cohesive service to supply those critical pieces of information. It seems like a simple thing and it should be. But as of today, in the plethora of information, it is quite complicated. We are working hard to make it simple.

<br />
Our first product is <a href="https://www.primetenders.com"> Primetenders </a><br />
It is a unique offering where one can find any government tender available.
